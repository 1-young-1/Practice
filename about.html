                    Soccer is viewed by many as a major sporting event in the world. 
                    The game of football has resulted to skill development in many nations across the globe
                    and has contributed in enriching individuals. Besides, sport in general and football in particular
                    have emerged as a single unifying factor, even in the moment of political,
                    ethnic and socio-religious tension and feuds. Nations across the world have united behind this game.
                    Football has bridged racial divide and brought people of other nation into a union of oneness.
                Most youths are ready to defy some of the challenges prevailing in the world today 
                such as unemployment and economic hardship, which has reduced them to the level of desperation. 
                Most of them have given up hopes and have buried their talents and indulge in activities such
                    as drug abuse, prostitution, gangsterism and banditry. It can therefore not be argued that idleness 
                    breeds crime and other numerous malpractices that can only leadto the destruction of individuals 
                    and their communities.In a Kenyan context, there are numerous challenges still predominant
                in most of its townships such as Kilifi, Mtwapa, Malindi, Mariakani and kaloleni Townships 
                in kilifi county. This is because the desire and zeal to conquer and be number one has 
                unfortunately not been matched with opportunities and facilities to nurture their skills and talents. 
                It is in this context that Kilifi All Stars Football Club and Academy was founded in pursuing 
                zeal to transform the lives of the budding Kilifian talents.
