            <p>In a region that does not count any industries and minerals resources that constitute
                a source of empowerment through gainful employment, the overall objectives
                 of this proposal resonate with KASA and include:
                Creating a community and sustainable academy in order to develop football,
                 in this part of Kilifi.Identifying sports talents in young people and giving 
                 them a chance at making a career even away from our academy. Engaging young people
                 in physical and moral Education with a view to reducing crime rate, drug abuse as well as the fight against HIV/AIDS.
                Training young people in the sustainable management of bio-diversities and environmental protection.
                Building friendship ties with stakeholders as well as other sports oriented entities
                 the world over and participating in activities that promote friendship, tolerance and
                 fight against racism and all forms of discrimination. </p>

                <h3>Academy:</h3>
                The Academy will succeed in giving a chance of self-esteem and discovery to young people,
                 which is a resume of our objectives.The Academy expects to cause young people to realize 
                 that sports can give them a future and above all that sports keep them out of various mal practices.
               Taking into consideration the poverty level in the townships and county, training activities offered
                by the academy shall give a cross section of young people a chance of playing and wining. The Academy expects 
                to build lasting ties with various stake holders with whom the future of young people may be made brighter.
               The Academy expects to instil a sense of responsibility and partnership in the participants, which shall then have 
               an overall effect on their day to day activities.</p>
               <p class="services-4">
               <h4>Community:</h4>
               The envisaged training activities shall reinforce the spirit of friendship and unity amongst young people
                who constitute a very active and consequently very volatile section of the population.
               The training activities shall be welcome by the local authorities as an antidote against the growing 
               rate of drug abuse.We finally expect that the nation shall discover some of the rough diamonds, 
               which need polishing in the young participants so that Kilifi should soon be proud of new stars 
               that may defend its colours at national and world stage including the Olympic Games, African Cup of Nations
               and the World Cup.Even if none of the above occurs, we would have succeeded in the physical and
                moral education of our young people and given them enough reason to dream, which dreams they may realize 
                some day with or without us. This is what we call success. </p>
